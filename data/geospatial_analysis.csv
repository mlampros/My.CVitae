Started Processing Sentinel-1,2017-05-01,,"Since 2017 I process satellite imagery and especially Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and Sentinel-2 (Optical Data). For the last one and a half years, I process Sentinel-5 TROPOMI (atmospheric data) and MODIS VIIRS satellite data. I’ve organized my code in R packages and applications and a sample of my work can be found in the following web link https://monopteryx.netlify.app/portfolio/"
Started Processing Sentinel-2,2017-06-01,,
Ranked 24th out of 3341 teams in the Kaggle Ship or Iceberg Challenge using deep learning ,2018-01-01,https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge,In January 2018 I participated in a geospatial challenge in the Kaggle competitive programming platform to predict whether an image contains a ship or an iceberg using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery and using an ensemble of Keras deep learning models I ranked  24th out of 3.341 teams

Started Processing MODIS/VIIRS,2019-08-01,,
Ranked 9th out of 221 participants in the TopCoder Circle Finder Marathon Challenge using object detection,2020-10-01,https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/d059ceb0-b81f-4769-bb4c-c976e1184d9f,In October 2020 I participated in a geospatial challenge in the Topcoder competitive programming platform to identify all circles from the provided images as accurate as possible using an Artificial Intelligence model and using a Pytorch object detection algorithm I ranked 9th out of 221 Registrants. For the pre- and post-processing of the Data I used besides Python also geospatial R packages such as stars and raster
Replicated the Segmentation of Satellite Imagery using U-Net Models for Land Cover Classification,2020-12-01,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02899.pdf,"I am also interested in Land Cover (Crop) multi-class classification tasks. I reproduced the paper, “Segmentation of Satellite Imagery using U-Net Models for Land Cover Classification” using various segmentation algorithms of the Keras framework. I performed the task by downloading and processing Sentinel-2 Analysis Ready Data and merged the data with the Corine 2018 Land cover masks."
